# Payment Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Fevas e-commerce platform now includes Stripe payment integration, allowing customers to securely pay for orders and your client to receive payments directly to their bank account.

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Payment Features
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Stripe Elements for PCI-compliant card processing
- **Real-time Payment Validation**: Instant card validation and error handling
- **Payment Success/Failure Handling**: Proper order completion or error recovery
- **Development Mode**: Mock payment service for testing without real payments

### âœ… Integration Points
- **Checkout Flow**: Seamless integration with existing shipping and tax calculation
- **Order Management**: Payment information stored with orders in admin panel
- **Shipping Labels**: Automatic label generation after successful payment
- **Order Status**: Orders marked as "paid" after successful payment

## Setup Process for Your Client

### Step 1: Create Stripe Account
1. **Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)** and click "Start now"
2. **Sign up** with your client's business information:
   - Business name and address
   - Business type and industry
   - Bank account for receiving payments
3. **Verify email** and complete account setup

### Step 2: Get API Keys
1. **Log into Stripe Dashboard**
2. **Go to Developers â†’ API keys**
3. **Copy the keys**:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
# Stripe Configuration
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# Existing Shippo Configuration
VITE_SHIPPO_API_KEY=your_shippo_api_key_here
```

### Step 4: Deploy Backend API
You have several options for the payment backend:

#### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
1. **Create `api/create-payment-intent.js`** (already created)
2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel
   ```
3. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard

#### Option B: Netlify Functions
1. **Create `netlify/functions/create-payment-intent.js`**
2. **Deploy to Netlify** with environment variables

#### Option C: Express.js Backend
1. **Create a simple Express server** with the payment endpoint
2. **Deploy to Heroku, Railway, or similar**

### Step 5: Test the Integration
1. **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Add items to cart** and proceed to checkout
3. **Test with Stripe test cards**:
   - **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - **Insufficient funds**: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

## How It Works

### For Customers:
1. **Browse and Add to Cart**: Normal shopping experience
2. **Checkout Process**:
   - Enter shipping information
   - See real-time shipping rates
   - Enter payment information securely via Stripe
   - Payment processed instantly
3. **Order Confirmation**: Receive confirmation with tracking info

### For Your Client (Admin):
1. **Receive Payments**: Money goes directly to their Stripe account
2. **View Orders**: All orders show payment status in admin panel
3. **Generate Labels**: Shipping labels created after payment
4. **Track Revenue**: Stripe dashboard shows all transactions

### Payment Flow:
```
Customer â†’ Stripe â†’ Your Client's Bank Account
     â†“
Order Created â†’ Shipping Label Generated â†’ Admin Notification
```

## Security Features

### âœ… PCI Compliance
- **Stripe Elements**: Handles sensitive card data securely
- **No Card Storage**: Card numbers never touch your server
- **Tokenization**: Payment methods stored as secure tokens

### âœ… Fraud Protection
- **Stripe Radar**: Built-in fraud detection
- **3D Secure**: Additional authentication when needed
- **Address Verification**: Automatic address validation

## Production Deployment

### 1. Switch to Live Keys
```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_key_here
```

### 2. Update Webhook Endpoints
In Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks:
- **Add endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **Events to listen for**:
  - `payment_intent.succeeded`
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed`

### 3. Test with Real Cards
- **Small test purchases** with real cards
- **Verify payment flow** end-to-end
- **Check admin panel** for order updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Payment failed" errors
- **Check API keys** are correct
- **Verify backend** is deployed and accessible
- **Test with Stripe test cards** first

#### 2. Orders not completing
- **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
- **Verify Stripe Elements** are loading
- **Check network requests** to payment endpoint

#### 3. Shipping labels not generating
- **Verify Shippo API key** is valid
- **Check order total** calculation
- **Ensure address** is complete and valid
